/**
 * FUNCTIONALITY
 * This class extends a Millard2012EquilibriumMuscle by including including
 * inputs and outputs to represent spindle afferents and Golgi tendon organs. 
 * 
 * MODEL SOURCE
 * The spindle afferent model comes from: Mileusnic et al 2006 "Mathematical 
 * models of proprioceptors. I. Control and transduction in the muscle spindle"
 * J Neurophysiol 96:1772-1788.
 * 
 * The GTO model is the one used in: Lin, Crago 2002 "Neural and mechanical 
 * contributions to the stretch reflex: A model synthesis" 
 * Ann Biomed Eng 30:54-67.
 *
 * CLASS EXTENSION
 * The implementation of this class was achieved by modifying the file
 * FatigableMuscle.h, which is part of the OpenSim API examples.
 *
 * The Muscle base class specifies the interface that must be implemented 
 * by the derived muscle classes.
 * 
 * The Millard12EqMuscleWithAfferents derives from Millard2012EquilibriumMuscle,
 * which is a concrete implementation of the  Muscle interface.
 * 
 * AFFERENTS SPINDLES
 * The dynamics for spindle afferents are handled by a member object of the
 * Mileusnic06Spindle class.
 * 
 * The Mileusnic06Spindle object requires muscle fiber "acceleration", which is 
 * not available from the Millard2012EquilibriumMuscle class, so this has to
 * be approximated numerically. To aid this, this muscle class provides a
 * low-pass filtered version of the fiber velocity, and the acceleration is 
 * provided as a state variable.
 * 
 * AFFERENTS TENDON ORGANS
 * The dynamics of the GTO are handled by an object of the Lin02GolgiTendonOrgan class.
